Feature: The initSite task initialize the static site

  # TODO: failed scenarios and priority of DSL over gradle.properties

  # with DSL, without site.yml, without site, without maquette, without gradle.properties
  # gradle.properties : bakery.config.path='site.yml'
  Scenario: `initSite` task against empty bakery project
    Given a new Bakery project
    And 'build.gradle.kts' file use 'site.yml' as the config path in the DSL
    And does not have 'site.yml' for site configuration
    And 'settings.gradle.kts' set gradle portal dependencies repository with 'gradlePluginPortal'
    And the gradle project does not have 'site' directory for site
    And the gradle project does not have 'index.html' file for maquette
    And the output of the task 'tasks' contains 'initSite' from the group 'Bakery' and 'Initialise site and maquette folders.'
    When I am executing the task 'initSite'
    Then the project should have a 'site.yml' file for site configuration
    Then the project should have a directory named 'site' who contains 'jbake.properties' file
    Then the project should have a directory named 'maquette' who contains 'index.html' file
    Then the project should have a file named '.gitignore' who contains 'site.yml', '.gradle', 'build' and '.kotlin'
    Then the project should have a file named '.gitattributes' who contains 'eol' and 'crlf'
    Then after running 'initSite' the task is not available using 'site.yml' configuration
